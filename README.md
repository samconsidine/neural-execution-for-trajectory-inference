# neural-reasoning-trajectory-inference
Neural algorithmic reasoning for pseudotime trajectory inference

TODO:
----
- [X] Save and load trained models
- [ ] Find bug in neural execution
- [ ] Write tests for neural execution
- [ ] Find alternative to cdist for calculating distance between pairs of points
- [ ] Integrate synthetic datasets
- [ ] Implement neuarlised KMeans 

Bugs:
-----
- [ ] MST solver is doing very little
- [ ] Centroids initialised between 0 and 0.5
